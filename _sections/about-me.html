<p>Hello, and welcome! I'm Shane, a dedicated JD candidate at the University of Illinois College of Law. My journey in the legal realm has been enriched by diverse experiences that have shaped my passion for the law and international relations.</p>

<p>I've had the privilege of serving as a legal intern at Proper Title LLC. in the bustling city of Chicago, where I delved into the intricacies of the legal profession. As an analyst at Move In and On LLC. in Allen, Texas, I honed my analytical skills and gained valuable insights into the corporate landscape. My summer internship at MagStone Law, LLP in the heart of the New York City Metropolitan Area provided me with a firsthand look at the dynamic world of law.</p>

<p>Currently pursuing my JD at the University of Illinois College of Law, I am actively engaged in the legal community, holding the position of President of the Real Estate Law Society. This academic journey is not just about learning the law; it's about actively participating and contributing to the legal profession.</p>

<p>I graduated from Colorado College with a Bachelor of Arts in Political Science and a minor in French. As a founding member of CCMUN (Colorado College Model United Nations) and a participant in various courses at Sciences Po, I've cultivated a well-rounded perspective on political and global affairs.</p>

<p>My commitment to academic excellence has been recognized through inclusion in the Dean's List at Colorado College. Additionally, I earned the distinction of Best Delegate at the Yom Kippur Historic Crisis, an honor bestowed by MEDMUN at Sciences Po.</p>

<p>Fluent in both Chinese and English, I bring a multicultural and multilingual dimension to my professional pursuits. Outside the academic realm, I co-founded and serve on the executive board of CCMUN, leading our team to participate in prestigious conferences.</p>
